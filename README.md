# 🌿 Open Green Lab Algarve

**Open Green Lab Algarve** is a community project in the mountains of Monchique (Portugal), exploring how we can live in harmony with nature. We blend permaculture, renewable energy, and open sharing to create a living laboratory for regenerative life.

## 🌱 What We Do

* **Food Forest & Nursery** — building a resilient ecosystem that serves as a classroom and inspiration.
* **Solar & Water Projects** — developing small-scale, open-source systems for everyday sustainability.
* **Workshops & Learning** — hands-on sessions about planting, solar cooking, greywater reuse, and more.
* **Community Exchange** — creating an open forum to share experiences beyond messaging apps.

## 🏡 Philosophy

We believe that technology should serve the earth, not dominate it. Every experiment we make — from a solar cooker to a compost system — aims to reconnect humans and ecosystems.

> “Small, local, and open — so everyone can take part.”
